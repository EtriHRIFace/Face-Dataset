## 1. Overview of swapped facial dataset 
  We created a facial dataset by capturing images in various environments using cameras, featuring faces adorned with masks, sunglasses, hats, scarves, or left unadorned. The dataset accounts for real-world conditions, including lighting, distance, pose, and camera resolution. To protect privacy, we transformed facial image data acquired in real-world scenarios into swapped faces and are making it available as open data. The compiled face swap dataset is accessible for research purposes
### 1) Face Swapping 
Face swapping is the process of changing the identity of a person in the target image to that of another person in the source image while preserving pose and attributes such as skin tone, lighting conditions, expression, and accessories. In other words, face swapping aims to generate a facial image with the identity of the source image while preserving the pose and attributes of the target image. It involves extracting unique facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth from the source image and capturing facial pose, angle, expression, lighting conditions, makeup, and other color-related scene features from the target image. These extracted attributes are then combined to create the desired facial image, incorporating the source identity, target pose, and attributes. The following example illustrates the generation of a swapped face using a source image and a target image.<br><br>

### 2) Data Collection
The facial dataset was collected with a total of 100 participants, including 50 males and 50 females by varying lighting, distance, pose, camera, and accessories as follows.
#### a) Target person
  * 50 males and 50 females
#### b) Acquisition Environment 
  * Types of cameras : UHD, QHD, FHD, HD cameras <br>
  * Camera height : 3m, 2.5m, 2m <br>
  * Accessories used: Mask, Sunglasses, Hat, Scarf <br>
  * Lighting conditions : Left, Right, Bilateral lighting <br>
  * Distance from the camera : 4m, 3m, 2m, 1m <br>
  * Pose variation : Frontal view, Left and right profile at 45 degrees/90 degrees <br><br>
  The following is a pie chart representing the distribution of images constructed based on the database acquisition environment.

#### c) Acquisition time
 * 2 hours in the morning, 2 hours in the afternoon, 2 hours in the evening (after sunset)
### 3) Source Images
 * 100 images from [CelebA-HQ-Deltas](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4qLcYyJmiz0TXY1NG02bzZVRGs?resourcekey=0-arAVTUfW9KRhN-irJchVKQ) are used as mask images, which are images used to swap the original facial images.
