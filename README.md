![Face Swapping Dataset](https://github.com/EtriHRIFace/Face-Dataset/wiki)
## 1. Overview of open facial dataset 
  We curated a facial dataset by capturing images in various environments using cameras, featuring faces adorned with masks, sunglasses, hats, scarves, or left unadorned. The dataset accounts for real-world conditions, including lighting, distance, pose, and camera resolution. To protect privacy, we transformed facial image data acquired in real-world scenarios into swapped faces and are making it available as open data. The compiled face swap dataset is accessible for research purposes
